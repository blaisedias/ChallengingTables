# ChallengingTables specification file
# Formatting Rules:
# 1. The '#' character is the start of a comment all text after that is ignored
# 2. a contiguous sequence of ',',whitespace is interpreted as single space.
# 3. level specification is 
#       Level text
# 4. sum specification is  
#   sum_type, count, numbers, numbers, ... 
#       where
#          SumType is one of 
#                   'Multiply2',
#                   'Multiply3',

#                   'SquareRoot',

#          count is the number of times sum type is repeated
#          numbers are one of
#            set: [number1, number2, number3, ......]
#              example:
#               [1,2,3,4,5,6]
#               [1,3,5]
#               [89, 79, 99]
#          OR
#            range: (firstNumber, lastNumber, step)
#               example:
#               (1, 6, 1) expands to 1,2,3,4,5,6
#               (1, 6, 2) expands to 1,3,5
# 
# To aid readability, you can add "labels" and write something like 
#   "Sum=Multiply2  Count= 11   Numbers= a=(11, 19) b=(11, 19, 1)"
#   "Type:=Multiply2  Repeat:= 11   Ranges:= a=(11, 19) b=(11, 19, 1)"
# the "labels" are ignored, and should be alphabets and end with
# a ':' or '='.
# For increased flexibilty the script doesn't police repeat sum specifications,
# this makes it possible to create test sums of the same type but with different
# ranges which can be useful.
